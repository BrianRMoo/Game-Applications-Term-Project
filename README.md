# Game-Applications-Term-Project
Create a playable 3D game using Unity3D.

The instructions were that the game must be 3D as well as playable. 

These are the scripts as I am removing the unnecessary files to enable a proper upload as the current build is 166MB but the source is over 2.4GB.
We were allowed to use any assets available, paid or free. As this was created two years ago I do not have access to the list of used assets. 
From memory the assets used were:
The asteroids, The planets and their textures and the laser sounds.
